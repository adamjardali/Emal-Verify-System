While I took the idea from Amigoscode's project, I have added several additional features and made modifications to suit my requirements. These additions include:

Integration of JWT tokens for authentication and authorization.
Enhancements to the user registration process.
Customization of email templates for verification messages.
Expanded error handling and exception management.
Improved testing coverage and test cases.
I would like to express my gratitude to Amigoscode for providing a solid foundation for this project. Their code and tutorials were instrumental in my understanding of Spring Boot and implementing the additional features.
